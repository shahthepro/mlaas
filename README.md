## MLaaS

**Note:** This is one of my works from years ago and still in progress. There are some bad code practises in the repo as I was learning MEAN stack while developing this one. The ML scripts are written in Python and inside the `modules/mlmodels/scripts` directory. I'm open sourcing this one and I'll probably rewrite the entire thing using a different stack. Preferably Golang/Vue/Postgres.
